# Make-a-Logo
Module 10: A command line application that uses node.js prompts to generate an SVG logo via the user inputs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Node.js to your pc
3. Within the command line/terminal, run npm install
4. Follow the command line prompts after inputting node index.js 

## Usage 
* The purpose of this application is to create simple form logos for personal use. 
* After the user follows the command line prompts using Node.js, within the 'lib' folder, a logo.svg file will be generated, showing an image within the browser. A sample image will be shown below.
* For future application, this can be modified to generate more complex SVG style logos and designs by altering the code for the shapes. Rather than having simple shapes, the text/characters can be integrated within the logo itself. 
* Example of a sample SVG logo that can be created:
